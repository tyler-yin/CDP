          The digital space is inundated with information, advertisements, cookies, news articles, algorithmic based feeds, personal status updates, and dog videos; as it continues to grow and evolve at an unpredictable rate, concerns of privacy, misuse of personal data, exploitation and persuasion of political beliefs, and the unregulated access to and production of content have become increasingly urgent topics.

          I find myself having more questions than answers (I do not have answers nor am I a proponent for  explicit answers):

          Through the lens of the words, “CONSUME”, “DIGEST”, and “PRODUCE”, I view the nature of human interaction with today's physical and digital space. This process is to gain a better understanding of confusion, multiplicity, and contradiction as opposed to arriving at explicit explanations as to why things are the way they are. 

          <br />
          <br />

          Over the course of this website, I collect 1) quotations from proponents and opponents of today's digital production culture and statistics of media consumption, digestion, and production 2) figures of data visualization about media consumption, digestion, and production, and 3) the images used as learning reinforcement for peoples' online assertions about digital consumption, digestion, and production. The following list includes some helpful guidelines and loose rules to assist the user in navigating and engaging with the content that follows.

          As an attempt to highlight the inundation of information of a 2019 digital space, the insidious effects of semiocapitalism, and the seemingly futile nature of the producer's search for truth and meaning, I simultaneously archive digital artifacts of our time for future reference. With “maximum effort, [and] minimal results”, I share my exploration of the digital unknown through exhaustive data collection, questioning, curiosity, contradiction, confusion, and admiration for the absurd.
